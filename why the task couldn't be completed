## ❌ Why the Task Couldn't Be Fully Completed

Despite understanding the goal of the project, several blockers and constraints made it difficult to fully complete the task within the available time. Below are the key challenges:

### ⚠️ 1. Lack of Platform Familiarity

* The task required working with **n8n**, a workflow automation tool.
* Many of us, including myself, had **no prior experience** with n8n.
* Understanding nodes, triggers, data handling, and workflows took considerable time.

### 📦 2. Unclear Requirements

* The problem statement was broad and included multiple data sources, agent types, and functionalities.
* It was unclear whether to focus on **one stock (like TSLA)** or the **entire dataset** of historical tickers.
* The expected format/output of agents (alert, report, etc.) was not well-defined.

### 🧠 3. Steep Learning Curve

* The stack involved **Python, APIs, n8n, machine learning, and data visualization**.
* Each of these has its own complexity, making it hard to learn and implement everything in parallel.

### 🔄 4. Constant Context Switching

* Switching between datasets (CSV, API), tools (Python, n8n, Git), and components (collection, analysis, alerting) slowed progress significantly.
* No single part was fully completed before jumping into the next, due to lack of clarity or technical issues.

### 🕐 5. Time Constraints

* There wasn’t enough time to:

  * Explore the tools and platforms.
  * Debug issues with node configuration and integrations.
  * Understand and organize the dataset (which contains thousands of files).

### 📉 6. No Working End-to-End Flow

* A complete working pipeline (e.g., collect TSLA data → analyze RSI → send alert) was not set up at the beginning.
* Without that early success, momentum and clarity suffered throughout the development process.

### 🤝 7. Lack of Collaborative Guidance

* This task required **multi-agent thinking** and **integration across components**.
* Due to limited shared understanding and documentation, collaboration didn't help much in reducing confusion.

## ✅ What Was Attempted

* Initial **Data Collection Agent** was designed using n8n.
* Real-time data from **Alpha Vantage API** was connected using the `HTTP Request` node.
* Historical stock data (CSV files) was explored and loaded.
* Git setup and partial automation were attempted with `README` documentation.
